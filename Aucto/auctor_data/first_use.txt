	B2(Chemistry 10 Honors):
		I already made up missing work from when I was sick, just need to retake the test because I got a 3.3(HAS TO BE DONE AND READY TO TAKE THURSDAY)
	B3(English 10 Honors):
		I missed a lot when I was out sick because it was the time when we were finishing out the essay, I need to either get one of my friends or mom to fill out the peer revision(better option is to j			just forge it because it doesnt matter), I need to put my rough draft through Utah Compose, and then I need to just make it a final. All that should take like 1 hour maybe 2, and then I have to 			do the podcast assignment.
